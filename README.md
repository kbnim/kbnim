My name is Nimród Kiss-Bartha. I'm a university student 🎓 studying Computer Science 🖥️ at the Faculty of Informatics at Eötvös Loránd University 🏫.

On this page, you can find some of my works that I'm proud of (or at least, not critical enough about them to revoke them from public accessibility). 
I'm a strong believer that the best way to evaluate one's work in the most effective, fair and all-encompassing way is to let them see the path of improvement that they had taken.

I recommend that you start with my university assignments in the following order, then continue with my hobby projects.

**University assignments**:
1. Imperative programming - `rev` command line utility [[link](https://github.com/kbnim/elte-fi-imperative-assignment/)]
2. Event-driven programming - Windows Forms [[link](https://github.com/kbnim/elte-fi-edp-winforms/)]
3. Event-driven programming - WPF [[link](https://github.com/kbnim/elte-fi-edp-wpf/)]
4. Event-driven programming - MAUI [[link](https://github.com/kbnim/elte-fi-edp-maui/)]
5. Operating systems - Easter-related assignment [[link](https://github.com/kbnim/elte-fi-opsys-assignment/)]

**Hobby projects**:
- `datastructs.h` - a library written in C containing elementary data types (string, vector, stack, etc.) [[link](https://github.com/kbnim/datastructs.h/)]
- My C++ lecture notes [[link](https://github.com/kbnim/cpp-jegyzet/)]

**About me**:
